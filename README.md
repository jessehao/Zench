# Zench

[![Swift Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/swift-4.2-orange.svg)](https://swift.org/blog/swift-4-2-released/)

Zench(= ZÃ© + Bench) is a development kit from my consistent personal accumulation.

composed by `extensions`, `protocols`, `supports(protocols which could append functions on Structs or Classes)` etc.

## Deprecating

Zench will separated into more clarity libs.

#### ExtCocoa

inherits all of extensions.

- ExtFoundation
- ExtUIKit

#### Supports

Inherits:

- StandardConfigurable
- Zench.Supports

#### Gist

all framework like stuff.



## Installation
```ruby
pod 'Zench', :git => 'https://github.com/jessehao/Zench.git'
```
